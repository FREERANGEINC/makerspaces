This was our 'seed hackspace', it did was not our own space par-se, but did allow us to keep active tools and workbenches in a shared co-working office space. We could use the space out-of-hours when the office workers were gone, and had a dedicated night of our own.It was a good seed space, since the cost was considerably lower than a dedicated 24x7 space. However, I do feel that this meant many of the original membership lost the original vision to get our own space - the net result being finding our own dedicated space took longer than originally hoped - 2 years rather than 6 months.","Yes, please add me to the mailing list","Member (or keyholder) access any time, Public access in set hours, Public access for courses or training only","We currently work on a 'pay what you want, but pay monthly' policy, with a £5 per month minimum. This is paid by direct debit, standing order, or paypal. We try to encourage people to pay what they think the space is worth to them, essentially an honesty system.Our average is about £16 per member, with a min of £5, and max £30.","For public access, i'd like to make it clear that 'public access' does not permit the public to use many of the tools. We have an open night on Thursday evening, and a generally welcoming stance any other time, but we are careful to ensure that whilst the *space* is open to the public, the *tools* are largely off-limits.We host public workshops, which are supervised and are covered under our insurance.For members to get 24x7 access to the space, we operate a 'vouching' process, where the trustees essentially get to know the new member directly or via other members reports. Once a trustee is happy that the new member is trustworthy, they are permitted to have keys and be on their own in the space.Some equipment in the space is off-limits to people that are not competent on that machinery. Typically we charge a fee for access to this specialist equipment (eg laser cutter, lathe, welding) to maintain a pot of money for maintenance and upgrades. This is sometimes misconstrued as a training fee, which it is not. All training in the space, outside of organised public workshops, is done on a member to member basis.","Long term project storage, Shared kitchen, Bookable event space, Social, non-working area, Toilets, Library, Wifi, Wired ethernet, Honesty system tuckshop",Children allowed in workspace,"The space is not wheelchair accessible unfortunately, due to the location within the general Rodhus building.Children are permitted in the space, but under supervision of a parent or nominated guardian.

This consisting of three distinct areas that provide a city wide benefit:This will be achieved by BML activity taking place every day throughout the year across two locations and as a schools and libraries programme: 1. BML Central - A city-centre location houses activities for individuals, artists, SMEs, and University and corporate teams, with easy access to smaller scale designing and prototyping, along with collaboration space and child care. Users pay for a membership package or take up a residency funded by other organisations.2. BML Factory - A South Bristol location, in Knowle West’s new Filwood Green Business Park (completion February 2015), provides a digital manufacturing floor that is a training ground for young people and adults who want to upskill. Many of the courses are funded allowing participants to gain both practical and life skills working on live com- missions with professionals.3. Maker Lab in a Box:SchoolsWith our mobile schools programme we will give children and young peoplepractical experience of digital manufacturing, enhancing their awareness of the possible careers of the future at a young age (Primary),and teaching them transferable skills foremployment (Secondary). This will begin in March 2015 with a year of experiments with six South Bristol schools. In three primary schools and three secondrary schools we are working with teachers, artists, technologists, pupils, trainees and apprentices to find creative and innovative ways of delivering the new ICT and computing curriculums and making technology more visible in schools.LibrariesWe are working with Bristol Libraries to help them respond in creative and sustainable ways to the changed environment of public spending cuts and the implications of new digital technology. In 2015 we will develop bespoke Maker Lab experiences to suit the needs of individual libraries, starting with the Central Library and continuingacross the city.","We are meeting the challenge of aiming to allow community access for all to a maker space.
