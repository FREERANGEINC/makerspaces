# makerspaces
initial (alpha) makerspaces data, incomplete. 

This data package is the initial release of the NESTA Makerspaces open data set.

It is provided without warranty, at an interim point in the data collection, so 
that makerspaces and the curious can see what we have so far and can see where there
are gaps that they can contribute to.
 
As researchers, we recognise that this release however interum has the potential to
remain in the public domain, we have taken measures to remove biographic data and only
included contributed data when the contributor agreed to publising under the open license.
